# My Portfolio

Welcome to the repository of my personal portfolio developed with React.js, Tailwind CSS, and Vite. This project aims to showcase my skills, experiences, and previous projects in a visually appealing and interactive manner.

## Technologies Used

- **React.js:** I used React as the main library for building the user interface, providing a dynamic and responsive user experience.

- **Tailwind CSS:** I adopted Tailwind CSS for styling the project, leveraging its utility classes for an efficient and quick approach to design development.

- **Vite:** I chose to use Vite as the bundler for the project. It offers a fast and efficient development environment for modern front-end applications.
